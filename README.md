# Distributed Sentiment Analysis using Fog Computing + MapReduce

## 📌 Project Description
A distributed sentiment analysis system using a Fog Computing architecture and the MapReduce paradigm to process social media comments from **Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram** in parallel across **3 nodes**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate Fog Computing architecture with **3 nodes**  
  ✔ 1 Master node  
  ✔ 2 Slave/Fog nodes  
- Implement **MapReduce** for distributed sentiment analysis  
- Analyze **positive/negative sentiment ratios** for each platform  
- Reduce latency by processing data **closer to the data source**
